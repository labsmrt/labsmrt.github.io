<p>I joined the lab in September as a MA part time student in Psychology. Now I am working as a IT consultant in a supply chain management company and earned my master degree in Information System Management at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology two years ago. I am interested in exploring the difference between Artificial Intelligence and human brain. My research interest is to examine the decision making process between AI model and human brain. In my free time, I like dancing and singing.</p>
