<p>As a MA student, I joined the lab in October 2022. Before that, I earned my Bachelor of Management, majoring in Public Administration at Sun Yat-sen University and served as a student assistant in the universityâ€™s mental health counselling centre during this time. Then I worked as an HR in a state-owned enterprise in mainland China for over one year.
Through these experiences, I am now interested in the cognitive process and brain activities when exposed to natural stimuli such as music, and how these findings could be applied to practical issues, enhancing human well-being in clinical and workplace settings.
In my spare time, I enjoy reading books in the company of music and watching documentaries on various themes. I also like travelling which creates the possibility to observe and experience different lifestyles in diverse cultures.</p>
