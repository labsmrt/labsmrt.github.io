<p>I'm an undergraduate student studying at The Chinese University of Hong Kong majoring in Psychology with a minor in statistics.  I joined the lab in 2022 as an undergraduate research assistant. I have a great interest in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Because to understand the world, we must understand ourselves – And to understand ourselves, we must study the brain. Currently, I am interested in using neural modeling and brain imaging techniques to understand working memory and auditory perception, but I am more than happy to explore other related topics.</p>
<p>Outside the lab, I like to watch anime and listen to J-pop music (Yoasobi, Co Shu Nie, ヰ世界情緒), anime music (“Come Sweet Death” in EVA, epic!), and VOCALOID music. Sometimes, I will also read Manga and light novels. A big fan of rhythm games and strategy games. A cat person. A person who always shows up with a suit and sometimes with a tie. Feel free to send me a message and just start a random chat about anything you like!</p>
