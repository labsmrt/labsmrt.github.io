**Teng, X., Larrouy-Maestri, P., & Poeppel, D. (2021). Segmenting and Predicting Musical Phrase Structure Exploits Neural Gain Modulation and Phase Precession. bioRxiv.**

Music, like language, is characterized by hierarchically organized structure that unfolds over time. Music listening therefore requires not only the tracking of notes and beats but also internally constructing high-level musical structures or phrases and anticipating incoming contents. Unlike for language, mechanistic evidence for online musical se...

**Teng, X., Ma, M., Jin, B., Blohm, S., Cai, Q., Tian, X. (2020) Constrained Structure of Ancient Chinese Poetry Facilitates Speech Content Grouping. Current Biology, 30(7), 1299â€“1305.e7.**

Ancient Chinese poetry is constituted by structured language that deviates from ordinary language usage [1, 2]; its poetic genres impose unique combinatory constraints on linguistic elements [3]. How does the constrained poetic structure facilitate speech segmentation when common linguistic [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and statistical cues [5, 9] are unreliable...

**Teng, X., Tian, X., Doelling, K., & Poeppel, D. (2018). Theta band oscillations reflect more than entrainment: behavioral and neural evidence demonstrates an active chunking process. European Journal of Neuroscience, 48(8), 2770-2782.**

Parsing continuous acoustic streams into perceptual units is fundamental to auditory perception. Previous studies have uncovered a cortical entrainment mechanism in the delta and theta bands (~1-8 Hz) that correlates with formation of perceptual units in speech, music, and other quasi-rhythmic stimuli. Whether cortical oscillations in the delta-the...

**Teng, X., Tian, X., Rowland, J., & Poeppel, D. (2017). Concurrent temporal channels for auditory processing: Oscillatory neural entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales. PLoS biology, 15(11), e2000812.**

Natural sounds convey perceptually relevant information over multiple timescales, and the necessary extraction of multi-timescale information requires the auditory system to work over distinct ranges. The simplest hypothesis suggests that temporal modulations are encoded in an equivalent manner within a reasonable intermediate range. We show that t...

**Teng, X., Tian, X., & Poeppel, D. (2016). Testing multi-scale processing in the auditory system. Scientific reports, 6, 34390.**

Natural sounds contain information on multiple timescales, so the auditory system must analyze and integrate acoustic information on those different scales to extract behaviorally relevant information. However, this multi-scale process in the auditory system is not widely investigated in the literature, and existing models of temporal integratio...
