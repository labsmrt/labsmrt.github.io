I joined the lab in November 2022 as a collaborator/honorary research assistant. Before that, I am an undergraduate student majoring in Financial Technology & Artificial Intelligence at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. IÂ am fascinated with interdisciplinary research. My research has been focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and Natural Language Processing, especially on how to capture the unquantified information of human beings by machine or computer. I am also interested in AI+X, for example, AI for healthcare, and AI for music. When I am not doing research, I play music and watch soccer. I like to read articles about politics and economics, I am also interested in philosophy and math.
