    SMRT Lab: <strong>Speech</strong> and <strong>Music</strong> are of utmost importance to human beings. We communicate through speech and connect with each other through music. Both speech and music sounds are enriched with <strong>Rhythms</strong>, displaying regular patterns in <strong>Time</strong>. At our lab, our primary goal is to unravel the mechanisms behind human perception of speech, the enjoyment of music, and the understanding of rhythms present within them. <br><br>To address these fundamental questions, we employ a diverse range of tools and methodologies, including EEG, MEG, fMRI, and behavioral measurements. Furthermore, we utilize cutting-edge computational techniques such as artificial neural network models and statistical models. <br><br>Our interdisciplinary approach bridges the realms of humanity and science, integrating valuable insights and techniques from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, hearing science, and artificial intelligence. Together, we strive to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between speech, music, rhythms, and time perception.
