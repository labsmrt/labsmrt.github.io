I graduated from the department of English at PolyU majoring in psycholinguistics. While at PolyU, I participated in psycholinguistics and developmental neurolinguistics projects, ranging from EDA and ERP to fMRI. Additionally, I briefly worked as an NLP and NLG product manager for an AI voice assistant at a technology company, where I was introduced to the concepts of Large Language Models and Computational Neural Science. Finally, I joined our lab since 2023.

My research focuses on utilizing multimodal MRI data to study language and cognitive performance. Currently, I am collaborating with researchers from Juntendo University and RIKEN, CBS in Tokyo, Japan on a fundamental science project.
