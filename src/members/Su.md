I currently work as a full-time research assistant in the SMRT Lab. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Natural Sciences (specializing in Cells and Organisms) with a minor in Social Science (specializing in Cognition, Brain, and Behavior) from Minerva University. Before joining CUHK, I conducted research on the neural mechanisms underlying implicit learning of associations between events or objects. My current work focuses on investigating how rhythm in music is perceived, using EEG. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and weightlifting.
