I joined the lab in 2023, embarking on my first lab venture as a fourth-year student in the Department of Translation. My academic background is diverse, with a minor in Linguistics and a study experience in Psychology at UBC. Prior to the lab endeavor, I briefly worked as a student assistant at RCT CUHK and a government affairs assistant at the EUCCC. 

Initially, my research focused on understanding language socialization of feminist translation and the role of conscious grammar in the acquisition process, from there I sparked an interest in the intersection of language and cognition. Now, I am working with Dr. Teng Xiangbin on his psycholinguistic project, decoding speech prosody through neural network models.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy drawing, writing, and listening to music. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals in this field and contributing to our collective understanding of language and cognition.
