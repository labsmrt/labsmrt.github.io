I joined the lab in 2024 as a full-time research assistant. Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology at SWJTU and my MSc in Financial Technology at HKUST. I switched to the domain of cognitive science for pure interest. Currently, I am exploring the field of cognitive science and neuroimaging with Prof. Xiangbin Teng. My research interests lie in how individuals perceive speech and music and the neural mechanisms behind them. When I am off work, I enjoy exercising and playing funky guitar.
