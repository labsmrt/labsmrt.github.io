I’m a postdoctoral fellow at the Brain and Mind Institute, Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages. My research is dedicated to exploring the neural mechanisms behind speech perception and production, primarily through electrophysiology tools like EEG, MEG, and intracranial EEG. I received my B.S. and Ph.D. in Neuroscience from New York University.
