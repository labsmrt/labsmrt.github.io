I am interested in why we enjoy music, and how the brain’s reward system, rhythm processing, and predictive mechanisms contribute to those experiences. Outside the lab, I enjoy running and hiking."

 I officially joined the lab in 2025, but I have been involved since my undergrad years as a student helper and completed my undergraduate thesis on neural entrainment to music rhythm using EEG here. I recently graduated from CUHK with a degree in Psychology. I am interested in why we enjoy music, and how the brain’s reward system, rhythm processing, and predictive mechanisms contribute to those experiences. Outside the lab, I enjoy running and hiking.
