I am joining this lab for my research practicum when I am now as a year 2 student. I just basically want to learn and gain experience through actual work, as well as meeting up more people in my field. Psychology really has its own charisma, she speaks for herself by understanding both the mind and behavior of people and categorize them into theories. Although I am still on my way discovering different areas of this major, I am now interested in clinical psychology. Still, I am more than delighted to participate in various fields before concentrating on a particular area and this is indeed my first lab work. Whenever I am exhausted from studying, I listen to music, be it classical or pop, always soothes me really well. I am also a big fan of novels that I enjoy visualizing them in my head far beyond watching movies.
