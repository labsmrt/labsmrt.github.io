After finishing my undergraduate studies in Psychology at CUHK in 2024, I joined the lab as a research assistant late summer. At the moment, I am still exploring my research interests but I have settled at speech and social cognition for now. When I'm not working, I try to stay active with my hobbies in rock climbing and badminton but usually just end up playing video games and reading instead.
