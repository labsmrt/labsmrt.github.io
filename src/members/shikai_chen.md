I joined the lab in 2023 as a PhD student in psychology. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Psychology and Behavioral Sciences at Zhejiang University. I am interested in exploring how humans understand speech and perceive time. Currently, my research focuses on the connection of body and brain rhythms, and their roles in speech production, with some tools like MEG, Biopac and EEG. In my spare time, I like to listen to music, and watch some movies. And this semester, I started doing regular running exercises.
