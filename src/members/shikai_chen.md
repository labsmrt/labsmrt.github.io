I joined the lab in 2023 as a PhD student in psychology. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Psychology and Behavioral Sciences at Zhejiang University. My early research during the undergraduate period was mainly about attention, working memory, and reward learning. With some research experience on EEG, fMRI, and TMS, I am now interested in exploring how humans understand speech, appreciate music, and perceive time. The neural mechanisms in speech and music rhythms appeal me a lot. In my spare time, I like running or doing other exercise, and listening to music (Jay Chou and Easonâ€™s music fascinates me most).
