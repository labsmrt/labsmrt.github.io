I am a full-time MA student in CUHK majoring in psychology and joined the lab in September 2022 as a student helper. I worked in the actuarial field for a while after graduating with an actuarial science major at HKU. Then, I decided to explore more in the psychology field to learn more, as I was convinced and interested in the empirical nature of cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In addition, I like playing the piano, reading, watching movies, playing badminton and biking in my leisure time.
