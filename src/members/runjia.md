I am a Master's student in Psychology, supervised by Prof. Zhou, Liqin at Beijing Normal University and co-supervised by Prof. Teng. I have a strong research interest in the cognitive neuromechanisms of the serial dependence effect. I received my B.S. degree in Applied Psychology from Shaanxi Normal University. My studies in psychology have ignited my curiosity and enhanced my understanding of human behavior, constantly providing me with new perspectives and insights. In my free time, I enjoy reading and taking walks in the park. I value the concept of harmony, which helps me maintain a balanced and centered life.
