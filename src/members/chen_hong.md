I am joining the lab in October 2023 as a postdoc. I received my B.S. and Ph.D. in biomedical engineering at Tsinghua University. I have investigated on how musical pleasure is affected by harmonic structure and performed behavior, scalp and intracranial EEG experiments on music perception using statistical models and music theory. Now I am interested in how the brain processes music, speech, and other auditory stimuli, specifically from acoustic to semantic information and even emotional feelings.

In my spare time, I love listening to and playing music. Among the many styles of music, I favor jazz because it is relaxing and inspiring. I play guitar, piano and drums and have been a member of a band. I also enjoy hiking. I think the beautiful view of the mountain is the best reward for a climb.
