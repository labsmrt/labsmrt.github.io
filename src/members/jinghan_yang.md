I joined the lab in September 2022 as an M.A. psychology student. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. in Education (major) and Business Administration (minor) at Tianjin University. My early research during the undergraduate period was mainly empirical. However, I am fascinated by the mysteries of the human brain as I come into contact with it. I am curious about how the differences in human brains affect people's daily life and eager to explore the world of neuroscience. In addition to my passion for research, I also love life. In my spare time, I do daily exercise, listen to music, and paint pictures to relax.
