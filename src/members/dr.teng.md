I was born in a small town in the northwest of China and later pursued my studies in Shanghai (BA), Beijing (MS), New York (Ph.D), Frankfurt (postdoc), and Berlin (postdoc). My research centers on unraveling the brain's mechanisms in processing temporal sequences, such as speech and music, utilizing diverse tools such as EEG, MEG, fMRI, and neural network models. While I used to enjoy sports and video games, these days, my interests have shifted towards juggling, reading philosophy, watching physics videos (e.g., space-time), and playing music. I feel incredibly lucky and grateful to be where I am today, and my aspiration is to teach and support students from diverse backgrounds in discovering their passion within academia or beyond. Come join me on this thrilling journey as we delve into the wonders of neuroscience and psychology and explore their impact on our daily lives.
