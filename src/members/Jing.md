I joined the lab as a PhD student in summer 2025. I received my BA in English at Guangdong Medical University, but I later developed my real interest in studying speech perception using neuroimaging and machine learning methods during my masterâ€™s study at the University of Zurich, where I received academic training in Neurolinguistics and Computational Linguistics. I have also worked on multiple speech perception related projects using EEG, eye-tracker, tACS, and the mTRF decoding models. My current research focuses on using iEEG to investigate auditory processing.
