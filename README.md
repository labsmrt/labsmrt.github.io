# Teng lab

Teng Lab focuses on understanding how human beings understand speech and appreciate music. 
This is the source code that sets up the lab's static website on https://labtengxb.github.io/.

## Overview

This project uses:
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate static files, packing with [Fylgja CSS](https://fylgja.dev/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build the source and publish
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site

## Quickstart

Assume you have basic Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript skills and have Git, Node.js and npm on your computer.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Get into the directory.
3. npm install the dependencies.
4. Set environment variable NODE_ENV to production.
5. Start a local server. Now you can modify the code and see your change locally.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/labtengxb/labtengxb.github.io.git
$ cd labtengxb.github.io
$ npm install
$ npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

## Cheatsheet

In brief, for each change, thereâ€™re 3 things to do: update, build then publish.

### Update

The `src` folder is where you update most of the contents.

Files ending with `.njk` are written in [Nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/).
The `.njk` files are named based on the content, for instance,
* `publications.njk` refer to the `Publications` page
* `team.njk` refers to the `Team` page

### Build and publish

Git commit and push the updates to the `main` branch when you get the updates done. 
Then Github Actions will help with the build (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) and publish. 
You can find the progress in the Github dashboard: https://github.com/labtengxb/labtengxb.github.io/actions

You should be able to see your updates online once it's been finished. 

## TODO
